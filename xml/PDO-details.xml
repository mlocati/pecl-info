 <s>PHP Data Objects Interface.</s>
 <d>Do not use this, as PDO has been moved into core (the php source) so this pecl extension is dead.

PDO provides a uniform data access interface, sporting advanced features such
as prepared statements and bound parameters.  PDO drivers are dynamically
loadable and may be developed independently from the core, but still accessed
using the same API.</d>
