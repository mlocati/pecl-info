 <s>Fuzzy hashing makes it easy to identify similar or almost identical text by simply comparing two hashes against each other.</s>
 <d>The ssdeep project page describes it as a library for &quot;...computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length&quot;.

For an in depth paper explaining context triggered piecewise hashes please see http://dfrws.org/2006/proceedings/12-Kornblum.pdf


ssdeep API Information
---------------------------

Requires at least ssdeep v2.5.

This extensions wraps the ssdeep fuzzy hashing API created by Jesse Kornblum.

For more information about ssdeep, the API and context triggered piecewise hashing please see http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/
