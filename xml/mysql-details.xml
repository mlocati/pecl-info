 <s>MySQL database access functions</s>
 <d>This extension provides the mysql family of functions that were provided with PHP 3-5. These functions have been superseded by MySQLi and PDO_MySQL, which continue to be bundled with PHP 7.

Although it should be possible to build this extension with PHP 7.0, you are strongly encouraged to port your code to use either MySQLi or PDO_MySQL, as this extension is not maintained and is available for historical reasons only.</d>
