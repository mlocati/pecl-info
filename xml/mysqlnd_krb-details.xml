 <s>Kerberos authentication plugin for mysqlnd</s>
 <d>The mysqlnd_krb extension is an authentication 
plugin for mysqlnd that enables connections to MySQL accounts
that use Kerberos authentication.

If a MySQL account is configured with Kerberos authentication
(using `IDENTIFIED WITH kerberos_authentication` clause
of `CREATE USER`, see [1]) then normally `mysqlnd` will not
be able to connect to such an account. With this plugin such
connections are possible provided that user has appropriate
tickets loaded into the Kerberos ticket cache (in this case
no password is needed in the connection data).

If a ticket for the MySQL service is not present in the cache
the plugin can fetch the required ticket from Kerberos provided
that user principal's password is given in the connection data.
