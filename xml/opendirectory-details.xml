 <s>PHP interface to OpenDirectory Framework</s>
 <d>Open Directory is a directory service architecture whose programming 
  interface provides a centralized way for applications and services to retrieve 
  information stored in directories. The Open Directory architecture consists of 
  the DirectoryServices daemon, which receives Open Directory client API calls and 
  sends them to the appropriate Open Directory plug-in.</d>
