 <s>Convert nested arrays into DOMDocument</s>
 <d>The extension converts nested PHP arrays and objects into DOMDocument.
  Some of projects use XSLT as a templating engine. To build XML for such engines,
  we need a very fast and memory efficient way to convert PHP nested arrays and
  objects into DOMDocument object. Also, produced XML should be straight-forward
  and as simple as it could be (BTW XMLRPC, SOAP and other XML-based formats are quite
  sloppy in this case). So dom_varimport has been introduced: it produces DOMDocument
  from a nested array near 20 times faster than a hand-made code in native PHP
  (1 MB XML with thousands of nodes could be generated in 1-2 ms).</d>
