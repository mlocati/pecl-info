 <s>A modification of PHP's standard XSL extension that caches the parsed XSL stylesheet representation</s>
 <d>The XSL Cache extension is a modification of PHP's standard XSL extension that caches
	the parsed XSL stylesheet representation between sessions for 2.5x boost in performance
	for sites that repeatedly apply the same transform. Although there is still some further
	work that could be done on the extension, this code is already proving beneficial in
	production use for a few applications on the New York Times' website.</d>
