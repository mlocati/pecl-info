 <s>Provides an image manipulation interface using libimlib2</s>
 <d>imlib2 is a very fast image manipulation library, but without the support for as many image formats as other libraries such as imagemagick.
You will need the imlib2 library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/enlightenment/ in order to compile this extension.
This extension is experimental. It's been tested on a number of Linux installs, but nothing else. Please report any bugs.</d>
