 <s>Provides interface to the libeio library</s>
 <d>This extension provides interface to the libeio library written by Marc Lehmann
    &lt;libeio at schmorp dot de&gt;(see http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libeio.html).

    Libeio is a an asynchronous I/O library. Features basically include
    asynchronous versions of POSIX API(read, write, open, close, stat, unlink,
    fdatasync, mknod, readdir etc.); sendfile (native on Solaris, Linux, HP-UX,
    FreeBSD); readahead. libeio itself emulates the system calls, if they are not
    available on specific(UNIX-like) platform.

    Currently this extension supports GNU/Linux and BSD platforms only. But you can
    try it on any UNIX OS.</d>
