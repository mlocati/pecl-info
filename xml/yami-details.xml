 <s>Lightweight inter-object communication infrastructure</s>
 <d>This binding allows PHP programs to communicate with servers
    written using YAMI, opening up a wide range of possibilities.

    YAMI (http://msobczak.com/prog/yami/concept/) is a tiny library
    that provides lightweight inter-object communication infrastructure.
    There are only three concepts that one need to understand (Domain,
    Agent,Message) in order to write high performance servers (and clients)
    in C/C++.</d>
