 <s>Cyrus SASL Extension</s>
 <d>SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (as defined by RFC 2222).  It provides a system for adding plugable authenticating support to connection-based protocols.  The SASL Extension for PHP makes the Cyrus SASL library functions available to PHP. It aims to provide a 1-to-1 wrapper around the SASL library to provide the greatest amount of implementation flexibility.  To that end, it is possible to build both a client-side and server-side SASL implementation entirely in PHP.</d>
