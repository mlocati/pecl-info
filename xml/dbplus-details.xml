 <s>db++ database functions</s>
 <d>db++, made by the German company Concept asa, is a relational database
system with high performance and low memory and disk usage in
mind. While providing SQL as an additional language interface, it is
not really a SQL database in the first place but provides its own AQL
query language which is much more influenced by the relational algebra
then SQL is.</d>
